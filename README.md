Team Analysis
By Jaime S

This program takes two input files filled with players and statistics for
various sports. The program then outputs a new file after adding the new 
statistics to the old statistics. 

To compile:
Move to the folder containing the program and type:
    "make"
or
    gcc -c team_member.c -o team_member.o

To run:
./teamData oldData.txt newData.txt outName.txt numStats numPlayers

You will need to enter all entries into the terminal correctly and fully or 
an error message will appear. The results will appear in the outName.txt file in
the project folder.

Sources: This program was written by Jaime Santoro.
The concept is from CS2301 Canvas under Project 3.
Additional sources were found in the Canvas lecture notes.
